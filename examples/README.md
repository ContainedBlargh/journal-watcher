# Examples

Here's a couple of examples of how pattern files can be defined.
Note that there are two types of files that result in identical patterns, `test_patterns.json` and `test_patterns.yaml`.
The last file, `complicated.yaml` is an example of how you might parse json data under the event `Customer Interaction`, note that opening and closing brackets (`{` or `}`) are deliberately avoided.
